Computer architecture could be a specification detailing how a group of software and hardware technology standards interact to make a computing system or platform. In short, computer architecture refers to how a computing system is meant and what technologies it's compatible with. As with other contexts and meanings of the word architecture, computer architecture is likened to the art of determining the requirements of the user/system/technology, and creating a logical design and standards supported those requirements.
